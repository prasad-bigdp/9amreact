React forms can be done in two ways. Based on forms, React components are divided as
  i. controlled components
  ii. uncontrolled components

  i. controlled components: In controlled components, form input values are controlled by state. we can save or manipulate the input values using state.
  we use events such as oninput,onchange,onselect,onclick,onsubmit
